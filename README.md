# Twitter-in-a-Key-Value-Store

# Description
You built an application to pump up to 1 million tweets into a database and to retrieve home timelines for random users. 
Probably you discovered that there are many factors that impact tweet insertions performance and that retrieving home timelines using
a JOIN query is especially slow. Twitter recognized that a relational approach would not scale with their growth and migrated their business
to a scalable NoSQL-based approach using Redis.

I will reuse the tweets and follower-followee datasets but now re- implement your API to use Redis instead of a Relational database.
